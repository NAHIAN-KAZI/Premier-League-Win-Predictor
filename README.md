# Premier-League-Win-Predictor
Premier League Match Prediction
This project uses Python to load the matches dataset, clean the data, encode the categorical variables, and build a Random Forest classifier to predict the outcome of Premier League matches.

Requirements
Python 3.6+
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Usage
To run the project, first, install the required packages:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn


Then, run the following command:

python main.py

This will load the matches dataset, clean the data, encode the categorical variables, and build a Random Forest classifier. The accuracy and precision scores of the model will be printed to the console.

To-Do
Try using other machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines or Logistic Regression.
Collect more data, such as historical match results, player statistics, and team form, to train the model on a larger dataset.
Deploy the model as a web service so that other people can use it to predict the outcome of Premier League matches.
